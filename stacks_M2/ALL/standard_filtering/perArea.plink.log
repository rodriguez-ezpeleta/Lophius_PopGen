317388 (of 317388) markers to be included from [ populations.plink.map ]
Warning, found 280 individuals with ambiguous sex codes
Writing list of these individuals to [ populations.plink.nosex ]
280 individuals read from [ populations.plink.ped ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 0 controls and 280 missing
0 males, 0 females, and 280 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 317388 SNPs
280 founders and 0 non-founders found
Writing individual missingness information to [ populations.plink.imiss ] 
Writing locus missingness information to [ populations.plink.lmiss ] 
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.971314
